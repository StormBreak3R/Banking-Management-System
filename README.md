# Banking-Management-System
## PURPOSE:


                                            “The banking management system is an 
                                    application for maintaining a person's account in a 
                                                            Bank.”

>To develop a software for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also, to enable the user’s workspace to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional banking software. 
In this project we are going to explain about Banking Management System. This project has facility to opening account, depositing, and withdrawing money. The Bank management system is an application for maintaining a person’s account in a bank. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. The following presentation provides the specification for the system.

 ## SCOPE:
>This software allows the users to apply for a new account and to update the previous statement. It gives them the facility to deposit money in the account or withdrawal cash from the account.

## OVERVIEW:
>The rest of the document deals with all the main features of this software. It describes various functions and gives details about how these functions are related to each other.
For better understanding, a data flow diagram has been attached in the document too. We tried our best to make the document simple and clean.


## EXISTING SYSTEM: 
>The existing system work manually. The existing system has got lot of intricacies within itself and need lot of human effort and paper works. All above the data need to be maintained on ledgers and maintaining this is a tedious and risky process. As the transaction’s increases, so the data too. So, the task of maintaining them increases exponentially. To view a data may need lot of paper to be searched. 
Some of the negative aspects of the existing system are as follows: 

>1) Time Consuming: There is a lot of time consumes in the bank, whenever we open account, deposit, withdraw or pass a loan than because of many customers with his/ her different purpose, than we wait for our turn sometimes 2 to 3 hours. 
>2) Reliability: This banking system is not fully reliable whenever the computer system is creating a problem and not work properly than sometime our data is damaged or lost. 
>3) Manpower: In this project manpower is fully used. A number of employees need to manage the banking system.
>4) Less Accurate: this system is not fully accurate, because sometime computerised system creates a problem in working, than the computer system also gives us wrong results. 
To overcome these, the proposed system has been suggested.





## PROPOSED SYSTEM: 

> In this project we are going to explain about Banking Management System. This project has facility to opening account, depositing, and withdrawing money. The proposed system is a computerized one. This has greater accuracy and efficiency. This takes only limited time for calculation. 
The proposed system can be used to maintain efficiently the BANKING schedule. In larger organizations employees are large. At that time also the proposed system is useful and helpful. The system includes users Administrator (HR) level. 
In this project we will have an admin-login feature, we want to fill the admin and password then we enter to home page, The home page facility shows all the include features about this banking project. we will have a number of options like open account, delete account, modify account, add employee record, delete employee record, modify employee record, deposit money, withdraw money and loan facility will also be available, we can easily choose any option according to our own requirement. We have also feature of validation. 

## System Architecture:
### ER Diagram:
>This design was made based on bank requirements. The system can encode customer information. Banking admin can have access to the customer status and information for important transaction. They can handle the data needed in managing customer and employee files as well as the transactions made by the customer and staff.

>The features included in the system ER diagram were the security and monitoring of the customer records, transactions and status. These features were also listed and recorded in reports that served as the history of transactions done in the system.

## Use Case Diagram:
A use case diagram is a visual representation of how a user might interact with a program. A use case diagram depicts the system’s numerous use cases and different sorts of users.

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) represents the flow of data and the transformations in Bank Management System.
In the DFD, input, processing, and output are used to represent and define the overall system.

## About Design

>The whole system was designed by making sure that it is user friendly enough. All class of people can use the system without any hesitation it was our primary thought.  We tried to keep the design as simple as we can so that the whole system becomes so easy for the users to use. It’s a simple, smooth and user-friendly system.
And we are also developing GUI in the system, so that our UI looks more attractive.
